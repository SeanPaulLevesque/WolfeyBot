# WolfeyBot — Project Guide for Claude

## What this project is

WolfeyBot is a Gen 9 VGC doubles bot that plays on Pokémon Showdown in the
**Champions format**. The live ladder rolled from Reg M-A to **Reg M-B** on
2026-06-17 (`BATTLE_FORMAT` in `main.py` is `gen9championsvgc2026regmb`); the
data/usage layer runs on the real Smogon **M-B** dumps since 0.37.0. It
connects via WebSocket, parses the battle protocol, and chooses moves using a
two-phase scoring engine (19 per-slot modules + 7 joint adjusters; see the
pipeline section below).

## Testing workflow — when a test fails, STOP and review together (IMPORTANT)

A failing test is a **signal to stop and review with the user**, never something
to make green by editing expectations. This is a hard rule:

- **Never edit a test's expected values/assertions, and never delete, skip, or
  `xfail` a test, to make it pass.** That throws away the regression guard.
- **On any failure, stop and surface it** — report (a) which test, (b) what it
  asserted, (c) what the code now produces, and (d) *why* the behavior changed —
  then **ask whether the new behavior is correct before changing anything.**
- A failure is exactly one of two things; decide **together** which:
  1. **Real regression** → fix the **code**, not the test.
  2. **Intended behavior change** → update the test *only after the user agrees*
     the new behavior is correct.
- **This applies to generated/bulk expectation tables too** (`snapshots/turn1_openings/baseline.md`,
  `tests/test_turn1_decisions.py`, etc.). Do **not** regenerate expected values
  wholesale to clear failures. Regeneration is allowed **only after** the user has
  reviewed and approved the behavior change that produced the diff — and even
  then, spot-check that the new values are actually correct, don't just trust the
  engine's current output.
- Editing a test is the **last** step, after agreement — never the reflex.

## Decision engine pipeline (two phases, since 0.7.0)

**Actions are `(move, target)` pairs.** `_build_actions` emits one candidate per
live opponent for every single-target move (fixed `target_slot`), so *which
target* is part of the action's identity — not a field that modules pick and
overwrite. Spread/status/self moves and switches are single candidates
(`target_slot=None`).

### Phase 1 — per-slot scoring (19 modules)
Each candidate starts at `weight = 1.0`; modules multiply — never add. A slot is
scored **in isolation** (blind to the partner) over its own candidates. The
numbering matches `docs/DECISION_ARCHITECTURE.md` and the `make_engine` list, but
**phase 1 is order-independent**: every module multiplies from precomputed
`TurnContext` facts and reads neither the running weight nor another module's
reasons, so the order is for readability only.

| # | Module | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | DamageOutput | `×(1 + min(dmg_fraction, 1) × 2.0)` scored against the candidate's **own** fixed target (spread/status: best live foe). **dmg_fraction is capped at 1.0 (lethal):** damage value saturates at the target's remaining HP, so overkill earns nothing — this is what lets `coordinate` route the right attacker (two equal OHKOs → the pairing falls to the chip that differs, not to whichever foe is overkilled hardest). Trade-off (accepted): a guaranteed KO via an overkill move no longer out-weights everything, so in rare cells it can yield to a switch/Protect. Damage modifiers come from the shared `_outgoing_attacker_mods(mon)` / `_outgoing_defender_mods(state, opp)` helpers (boosts, burn/status, HP, Flash Fire, times_hit / opp boosts, current HP, screens) — the single source of truth all `outgoing_damage` callers splat in, so a new modifier added there is picked up everywhere |
| 2 | ThreatElimination | "Can I guarantee a kill?" → ×5.0 when `ctx.guarantees_ohko(slot, move, its target)`. **Unconditional** now — the "will I die before I act?" ×0.2 cancel is a separate `DoomedModule` (#3). No target override (target is fixed) |
| 3 | Doomed | **Per-candidate** (`_move_undeliverable`): ×0.2 on each attack a certain killer would land before — so a priority move that out-speeds the threat is spared (revenge-KO) while slower moves are cut; Protect/switch untouched. Split out of ThreatElimination |
| 4 | PriorityKill | ×3.0 on a **priority** move (`priority_bracket > 0`) that `ctx.guarantees_ohko`s its target — it removes the foe before it can act, so prefer the priority KO over a slower one. Gated on guaranteed OHKO, so weak non-KO priority moves get nothing |
| 5 | PriorityBlock | ×0 on a **priority** attack while any live opponent has a priority-block ability (`_PRIORITY_BLOCK_ABILITIES` = Armor Tail / Queenly Majesty) — these block priority vs the holder *and its ally*, so it can't connect. Protect/switch/non-priority untouched; reads `_effective_ability` (assumes Armor Tail on an unrevealed Farigiraf). Composes with #4 (3.0×0=0) |
| 6 | ProtectValue | **Single row** on Protect-family moves when `ctx.is_threatened(slot)`: ×2.5. The partner-clears ×3.0 is now a phase-2 adjuster (`PartnerClearsAdjuster`, J6); the 1v1/2v1 "Protect only delays" ×0.4 cancels are a separate `EndgameStallModule` (#7) — one concern per module |
| 7 | EndgameStall | Protect ×0.2 when `ctx.is_threatened(slot)` and the board is a 1v1 endgame or 2v1 advantage (Protect only delays; ×0.4 → ×0.2 in 0.44.1, user-tuned — net with ProtectValue's ×2.5 is 0.5). Split out of ProtectValue |
| 8 | TurnOrder | By rank in the 4-mon turn order (pos 1 = we act before all 3 other actives): pos 1 ×2.0; pos 2 ×1.5; pos 3 ×1.0; pos 4 ×0.75 — attacks only |
| 9 | Urgency | One urgency boost per turn, first applicable setup in `_SETUP_TYPES` order (TR first): a setter present & its effect stoppable (not active, or last turn) → all attacks ×`SETUP_URGENCY` (flat ×2 for any setup). Target-agnostic — bias toward attacking, not stalling. Walks the shared `_SETUP_TYPES` registry, so a new urgent setup (screens, …) is one new row. (No TR↔TW cross-guard: the meta runs no mixed TR+TW teams.) |
| 10 | Setup Denial | A candidate aimed at a setter it guaranteed-OHKOs (`ctx.ohko`), that we outspeed, whose setup move has no +1 priority (Prankster/Gale Wings) → ×`SETUP_DENIAL` (flat ×2 for any setup). At most one denial per action (TR claim wins); active effects can't be denied. Same shared `_SETUP_TYPES` registry as Urgency (#9) |
| 11 | OppProtectRecency | ×1.3 if the candidate's target used Protect last turn |
| 12 | ConsecutiveProtect | ×0.2 if we used Protect last turn — no exceptions |
| 13 | FakeOut | `ctx.fake_out_fired(slot)` (fresh Fake Out user on field): Protect ×2.0, all attacks ×0.5 — for **every** slot |
| 14 | FieldCondition | turns_left=1 or 3 → Protect ×3.0 (stall every other turn) |
| 15 | Redirection | Hedge single-target attacks vs an active Rage Powder / Follow Me user: ×(damage to the redirector, capped 1.0); immune→×0, OHKO-on-redirector→×1.0. Exempts spread/status/switch, a Stalwart/Propeller-Tail attacker, and (Rage Powder) a Grass / Overcoat / Safety-Goggles attacker |
| 16 | SwitchTempo | Flat cost of switching at all: ×0.8 on every switch (forfeit the turn + concede a free hit). A switch must earn its keep via #17/#18 |
| 17 | SwitchOffense | ×(1+g), `g = max(0, switch_in_offense − current_offense)` (best single hit to the live foes). Floored at 0 — a softer-hitting defensive switch isn't penalised here. `_best_offense` is full-damage-modifier-aware via the shared `_outgoing_*_mods` helpers, for **both** the current mon (its boosts/burn/HP) and the switch-in (its own — e.g. a persistent burn), and the opponent's boosts/screens — so a debuffed mon vs a +Def wall is judged on the real board |
| 18 | SwitchSafety | One `_switch_in_survives` board check: ×4.0 if the current mon faces a connecting OHKO and the switch-in survives (escape); ×0.3 if the switch-in is itself OHKO'd (soft discount, not a veto). Same-bench-mon collision is phase 2. `_switch_in_survives` (and the active-mon threat facts in `build_turn_context`) are full-modifier-aware via the shared `_incoming_attacker_mods(opp)` / `_incoming_defender_mods(state, mon)` helpers — so a +Atk foe / our screens / our boosts all count |
| 19 | BoostedTarget | Attacks aimed at a stat-boosted opponent ×(1 + 0.4 × Σ positive stages) — 1 stage ×1.4, 2 ×1.8. Punish the snowball (endgame autopsy: opp boosted in 61% of late loss-turns vs 38% in wins). Positive stages only (accuracy/evasion count); spread attacks take the most-boosted live foe; Protect/switches untouched |

### Phase 2 — joint coordination (`DecisionEngine.coordinate`)
Phase 1 yields a ranked candidate list per slot. `coordinate` then picks the
**best joint pair** — `argmax (w0·factor_a)·(w1·factor_b)` over all candidate
pairs — where the `JointAdjuster`s below are the *only* cross-slot effects. With
all factors 1.0 the argmax is each slot's independent best, so coordination only
moves a choice off the per-slot optimum when a real interaction makes another pair
better. The chosen pair's per-slot factors are **baked into** the actions'
weights (so a decision's weight reflects the joint effects). `main.py` runs the
turn as: phase-1 score all → `coordinate` → record/mega/emit.

| Adjuster | Effect (per-slot factor on the pair) |
|---|---|
| Doubling | Both attack the same target: flat ×0.4 (penalty on the higher slot) — the spread-your-damage tax. Just the base penalty; the overkill near-veto is its own adjuster |
| Overkill | One slot already guarantees the OHKO on the shared target → ×0.05 near-veto on the *non-killer* (wasteful doubler), so the pair that **spreads** onto the survivor wins (emergent "redirect"). Composes on top of Doubling |
| JointSetupDenial | Both attack the same `_SETUP_TYPES` **setter**, neither solo-OHKOs it, but the summed **min rolls** kill it and both attacks resolve before it moves → waive the doubling tax (×1/0.4) and apply ×`SETUP_DENIAL` (×2). The combined kill no per-slot module can see (born from the 8-52 Swampert+Pelipper record: two ~0.7 hits kill Pelipper pre-Tailwind, but the doubling tax kept routing the second attacker onto Swampert). Reads `ctx.min_dmg` |
| Coordination | A **gratuitous** lone Protect (no `incoming_ohko`/`protect:`/`field_condition` reason) beside an attacking partner: ×0.5 on the Protect → favour double-attack; justified Protects and double-Protects untouched |
| FakeOut (free) | When **either** slot attacks, divide the partner's Fake-Out multiplier back out (attack un-halved, Protect un-boosted; known from `ctx.fake_out` + the action type) — a pair pays the Fake-Out adjustment once, never twice; symmetric since 0.7.2 |
| SwitchCollision | Both slots switch to the **same** bench mon → ×0 |
| PartnerClears | One slot Protects against a connecting OHKO **and** the partner's chosen attack guaranteed-OHKOs that threatener → ×3.0 on the Protect (survive while the partner removes it). Was a phase-1 ProtectValue row; moved to phase 2 because "is the threat cleared?" depends on the partner's actual action |

There is no scoring-order blind spot: slot 0 is never committed before slot 1 is
seen. The old greedy + `recoordinate` re-pass (0.6.8–0.6.10) is gone — its
overkill-redirect and gratuitous-Protect repairs are now emergent from choosing
the best pair.

### Key constants in engine.py / modules.py
- `TurnContext` (modules.py) — per-turn precomputed facts: `doomed[slot]` (KO'd
  before acting), `ohko` (set of `(slot, move, opp_slot)` guaranteed-OHKO
  triples), `incoming_ohko[slot]` / `incoming_certain[slot]` (opp slots whose
  max / min roll OHKOs us), `neutralized[opp_slot]` (opp KO'd before it acts),
  `fake_out[slot]` (Fake-Out adjustment applies), and board counts behind the
  1v1/2v1 rows. Built once per turn by `build_turn_context` — the **only**
  place damage calcs run for yes/no facts — and cached via
  `_ensure_turn_ctx(state)` (keyed on `state.turn`). `_partner_can_ohko` /
  `_opp_neutralized_before_acting` / `_ko_before_acting` are thin fact readers
  (tests patch them as seams; the build passes the partial ctx explicitly)
- **Forme resolution — one resolver, two jobs (since 0.16.0).** `mon.species` is
  the raw protocol name (base before `|detailschange|`, mega after), so it is
  **never** keyed off directly for modelling. Two canonical helpers:
  - **`_assumed_species(mon)` — inference (the modelling answer).** Population-
    weighted forme via `data.assumed_forme` (a pre-mega Charizard → Charizard-
    Mega-Y; revealed mega/non-stone item overrides). All stats/types/ability/
    item/damage/speed use this (via `_offense_species`/`_defense_species`).
  - **`data.base_forme(name)` — identity normalisation (matching only).** Strips
    the mega suffix so two names for the same line compare equal. Used **only**
    for set membership and log↔log matching, never as a modelling choice.
  - **Membership predicates** `_is_fake_out_user` / `_is_tr_setter` /
    `_is_tw_setter` compose them as `base_forme(_assumed_species(mon)) in <SET>`,
    so the species sets hold **base names only** (no `-Mega` duplicates —
    enforced by `test_no_mega_entries_in_species_sets`). Inference still applies
    (a pre-mega Lopunny is recognised as the Mega Fake-Out user it becomes).
  - The `pin` log keys by the *assessed* forme (`_offense_species`), and
    `tools/accuracy_report.py` reconciles `pin`↔`ev` via `data.base_forme` — no
    local copies of the normaliser.
- **Opponent inference seams (modules.py, since 0.7.6)** — every fact about an
  unrevealed opponent goes through these helpers: `_assumed_species(mon)`
  (above), `_effective_ability(mon)` (revealed > top-usage ability of the
  assumed forme — so a pre-mega Pyroar → Pyroar-Mega → Fire Mane),
  `_effective_item(mon, evidence)` / `_opp_item(state, mon)`
  (prefer `_opp_item` wherever `state` is in scope), and `_opp_has_item(state,
  mon)` — the **does it hold *any* item** belief Poltergeist needs (True unless
  `ItemEvidence.consumed` / `item_consumed`; unknown → assumed held, since
  `_opp_item` returning None conflates "consumed" with "don't know which"). It
  feeds `damage.py`'s `defender_has_item` (Poltergeist → 0 vs an itemless target)
  through the `_*_defender_mods` helpers and the OHKO-fact loop. Item inference is a
  **usage-stats prior resolved against observed `ItemEvidence`** (since 0.12.0):
  held-now > `consumed`→None > `confirmed` > field-stint consumed > prior with
  `evidence.ruled_out` removed. `_assumed_item(species, ruled_out)` walks the
  usage list skipping ruled-out items; the 25% bar (`_ASSUMED_ITEM_MIN_PCT`)
  gates **only the literal top item**, and once a higher-usage item is ruled out
  it commits to the next-most-likely **unconditionally** (observation narrowed
  the field). `ItemEvidence` (battle_state.py, on `BattleState.opp_item_evidence`,
  keyed by normalized ident so it survives the per-switch object replacement) is
  fed by the parser: ≥2 distinct moves in one stint → rule out `CHOICE_ITEMS`;
  being outsped when even its slowest scarf would be faster → rule out Choice
  Scarf (`_observe_speed_from_history`, run from `build_turn_context`);
  **outspeeding us when even its fastest non-scarf spread couldn't → rule Choice
  Scarf *in*** as `evidence.inferred` (`_infer_scarf_from_speed`, 0.30.0; same
  bracket, no TR/TW/weather); `[from] item:` / `-item` → `confirmed`; `-enditem`
  → `consumed`. **Choice lock (0.30.0):** a believed-Choice opponent that has used
  exactly one move this stint is locked into it (`_choice_locked_move`) — the
  incoming-threat facts assess `only_moves=[locked]` instead of its whole
  movepool (resets on switch). This **one item belief**
  feeds **both** damage math and the speed pipeline (since 0.11.0): `turn_order`
  applies it via `data.items.speed_multiplier` (Choice Scarf ×1.5, Iron Ball /
  Macho Brace ×0.5) — `speed_distribution` is a pure *spread* prior with no scarf
  branch. Focus Sash/Sturdy set `DamageResult.ko_prevented` (damage.py), which
  gates `is_ohko`/`ohko_with_max_roll` — multi-hit moves break Sash naturally
- `JointAdjuster` (engine.py) — phase-2 base class; `factor(state, slot_a, a0,
  slot_b, a1) -> (factor_a, factor_b, reason)`. Concrete: `DoublingAdjuster`,
  `OverkillAdjuster`, `CoordinationAdjuster`, `FakeOutAdjuster`, `SwitchCollisionAdjuster` (modules.py)
- `_PROTECT_MOVES` — frozenset of all Protect-family move names
- `_FAKE_OUT_USERS` / `_TR_SETTER_SPECIES` / `_TAILWIND_SETTER_SPECIES` —
  frozensets of **base names** (membership normalises megas via the predicates
  above). FakeOut: Incineroar, Kangaskhan, Tinkaton, Weavile, Sneasler, Lopunny,
  Toxicroak, Salazzle, etc. TR (≥40% usage): Farigiraf, Oranguru, Hatterene,
  Cofagrigus, Runerigus, Slowbro/Slowking variants, Reuniclus, Wyrdeer, etc.
  TW (≥20%): Talonflame, Whimsicott, Aerodactyl, Noivern, Pelipper, Corviknight,
  Dragonite, etc. (Champions-legal only; derived from usage stats)

## Important API patterns

### Building a test BattleState
```python
from battle import BattleState, Pokemon
from decision.modules import make_engine
from team import find_member

s = BattleState(battle_id="test", my_side="p1")
s.my_actives = [make_our_mon("Garchomp"), make_our_mon("Kingambit")]
s.my_team = list(s.my_actives)
s.opp_actives = [make_opp_mon("Incineroar"), make_opp_mon("Farigiraf")]
s.available_switches = [make_our_mon(b) for b in bench]
s.moves_per_slot = [[{"move": m} for m in tm.moves], [...]]
s.my_last_moves = ["", ""]
s.opp_last_moves = ["", ""]
s.my_slot_decisions = [None, None]
s.my_disabled_moves = [None, None]   # required
s.my_encored_moves = [None, None]    # required
s.opp_tailwind = False
s.opp_tailwind_turns_left = 0
s.trick_room = False
s.trick_room_turns_left = 0
s.weather = None
s.my_tailwind = False
```

**Opponent Pokémon at unknown HP:** use `hp=100, max_hp=100, hp_is_percentage=True`
→ engine uses typical-spread stats for damage calcs.

**Our Pokémon:** use `find_member(species)` to get actual stats/item/ability.
On Turn 1, use pre-mega species name (e.g. `"Aerodactyl"`, not `"Aerodactyl-Mega"`).

### Scoring
```python
engine = make_engine()
ranked = engine.scored_actions(state, slot)   # list sorted best-first
best = ranked[0]                              # Action with .move_name / .switch_target / .weight / .reasons
```

## Running things

```
# Run the bot (defaults to --team meta-team; baseline roster if that can't resolve)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py --team meta-team@v1   # pin a version to A/B
.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py --team off-meta-team  # runs on its bound account
.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py --list-teams          # teams + accounts + validation
.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py --max-games 5         # play N games then self-stop
.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py --team ""             # force the baseline roster

# Run tests
.venv\Scripts\pytest

# Regenerate a decision snapshot (only after an approved behavior change)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools/gen_snapshot.py --scenario turn1_openings --team baseline
```

**Never prefix shell commands with `cd` — or `timeout`, or anything else.**
The tool's working directory is already the project root and persists between
calls. Allowlist entries are **prefix matches** (the first token must be the
allowlisted binary), so ANY prefix — `cd <repo> && ...`, `timeout 100
.venv/Scripts/pytest -q` — defeats them and forces a manual approval every
single time. Run commands bare with relative paths (`.venv\Scripts\pytest
-q`); if a command might hang, use the Bash tool's own `timeout` parameter,
never a shell `timeout` prefix.

**No `$(...)` command substitution, no `>`/`>>` shell writes — anywhere, ever.**
`$()` nests arbitrary commands, so it forces approval no matter what it wraps
— `sed -n "$(grep -n 'X' f),+10p" f` (the code-reading one-liner) burned ~6
approvals in one sitting. Locate code with the **Grep tool** (`-n`, `-A/-B/-C`
context) and read it with the **Read tool** (offset/limit) — both prompt-free.
Shell writes (`printf ... >> file`) are the Edit/Write tools' job.

**No heredocs, no `cat >> file` appends.** `python - <<PY` and `cat >> x
<<EOF` are arbitrary-code/write prompts that can never be safely allowlisted.
Instead:
- **File changes** (code, tests, docs) → the Edit/Write tools, always.
- **Ad-hoc analysis** → Write the snippet to **`tools/scratch.py`** (the
  designated gitignored scratch slot) and run it — `tools/*` is allowlisted,
  so this is prompt-free; overwrite it freely per investigation.
- **Releases** → `tools/release.py <version> --notes <file>` does the whole
  chore (version bump + CHANGELOG prepend from the notes file + snapshot
  regen + full suite) in one allowlisted call. Write the notes body with the
  Write tool first.

**Permissions (2026-07-10):** file Read/Edit/Write is auto-allowed **only
inside this project** (`.claude/settings.json` path-scoped rules); anything
outside — home dir, AppData, other repos, the `~/.claude` memory files —
prompts. So keep scratch **inside the repo**: commit messages / release notes
go in the gitignored `tools/scratch/` dir (not the AppData scratchpad, which
now prompts), and ad-hoc analysis stays `tools/scratch.py`.

**The automation IS the interface (user directive, 2026-07-10).** Prefer the
project's own scripts over composed shell for every routine operation, and
when a script falls short, **extend the script** rather than working around
it in bash. One bare allowlisted command per Bash call — no pipes, chains,
substitutions, or redirects. The full set:
- tests → `.venv\Scripts\pytest -q` (or `./run_tests.bat`), bare
- code commits → `tools/commit_code.py -F <msgfile> <paths...>` (stage +
  commit + push in one call; explicit paths only, never resets)
- data commits → `tools/commit_push_data.py`
- releases → `tools/release.py <ver> --notes <file>`
- games → `tools/run_games.py [N]`; analysis → `tools/scratch.py`
Destructive git (checkout --, reset, rm) stays manual on purpose.

## Pending tasks

- **Task #3** — Audit switch-in order logic after a faint
- **Task #4** — Build lead selection framework. *Engine-grounded (0.38.0):*
  `select_leads` scores every C(n,2) lead pair on a real turn-1 `BattleState`
  vs the predicted opp pair (best phase-1 attack weight per slot, product over
  the pair; ×0.5 when the engine's best action for a lead is a **switch** —
  self-refuting lead; TR/undeniable-TW rosters add averaged field variants).
  `select_team` uses per-member engine damage matchups vs the opp six with
  native mega demotion (second stone holder re-evaluated as its base form).
  The old type-chart scoring remains only as the fallback for unresolvable
  members (synthetic fixtures). `tools/preview_backtest.py` replays logged
  previews through the current selector for validation.
  *Opponent-lead prediction is co-occurrence-aware (0.34.0):*
  `data.lead_stats.predict_pair` prefers the previewed duo actually **co-led**
  most (a `pairs` map in `lead_stats.json`) over the two highest *individual*
  leads, which otherwise pairs two rarely-together supports (Whimsicott+Farigiraf
  co-led only 5×). Falls back to anchor+real-partner, then top-2 singles.
  **Activate by rebuilding `lead_stats.json` with `pairs` (`tools/build_lead_stats.py`
  or any `record_leads` reseed)** — inert (singles fallback) until then.
  Remaining idea: validate the row magnitudes (×0.85) against the next
  100-game sample's led-vs-back splits.
- **Task #5** — Stat-aware mega selection. **COMPLETE (0.44.0):** `select_team`
  demotes a second stone-holder natively (engine matchup scores, 0.38.0), and
  `select_mega` now designates the brought stone holder with the highest
  **engine gain** (`mega_val − base_val` from `_engine_matchup_scores`),
  replacing the old defensive type-delta. The whole preview pipeline is
  engine-grounded; the legacy type-chart path was deleted in the 0.44.0
  cleanup.
- **Ongoing** — Investigate weight issues surfaced by `snapshots/turn1_openings/baseline.md`. The
  FakeOut over-protection (×0.5 discount looked too aggressive; gratuitous lone
  Protects) is now addressed *via coordination* — `CoordinationModule` (0.6.9)
  flips a gratuitous lone Protect to an attack beside an attacking partner,
  rather than re-tuning the FakeOut multipliers. Remaining: opponent **setup**
  (Tailwind/TR/defensive boosts) is the biggest loss correlate (59.8% of 0.6.8
  losses) — largely a team gap (no Taunt/Haze/speed-control), tracked separately.

## Current version

Single source of truth: **`version.py`** (`__version__`), imported by `main.py`
(battle-log folder + elo log) and `tools/gen_snapshot.py` (snapshot header).
Bump that one line per release and add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry; everything else
derives from it. See `CHANGELOG.md` for full history.

## Compact instructions

When compacting, always preserve:
- The 13-module pipeline order and what each module does
- Current team (species, items, moves)
- Any weight bug currently under investigation and which matchups reproduce it
- Pending task numbers and descriptions
- Key file paths and API patterns (BattleState construction, scored_actions)
- Current engine version
